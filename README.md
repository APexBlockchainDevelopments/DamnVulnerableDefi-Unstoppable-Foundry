## Damn Vulnerable DeFi ##
This is a repurposed project re-written in a Foundry/Solidity. 
Tincho is the original author for these challenges however as foundry grows in popularity I figured it may be beneficial to some users to see these challenges in Foundry instead. 


## Original Challenge Description ##
There’s a tokenized vault with a million DVT tokens deposited. It’s offering flash loans for free, until the grace period ends.

To pass the challenge, make the vault stop offering flash loans.

You start with 10 DVT tokens in balance.
